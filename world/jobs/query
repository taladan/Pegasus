* Messages only belong to a unique object type Job()
* "Reply" functionality appends messages to extant messages

Reply structure:
+job/reply Job/id=message

The job will be the listing (index + 1) of the job in the order of self.jobs_list
Ideas for tiered level commenting system:
    Each message should have a unique id (hash)
    Comment children can be handled via tags.

My ideas on access:
Players who run factions should be able to be tagged as "BucketAdmin" category:"jobs"
and be allowed to administer just that bucket for faction stuff...perhaps a jobs
subsystem for guilds or factions so they can separate issues?

Need hooks so that when a person is added to a faction the addition to the job/bbsys
can be automagic.

Anomaly stuff:
Jobs has a tiered access structure. By changing who has access to
various commands, you can selectively allow players like builders into the
system so they can work. The access locks are on the bucket object.
Bucket access locks are stored at the bucket level.

HAS_ACCESS: Return TRUE if a player can access the +jobs system.

ADD_ACCESS:      Returns True if a player can use the /add command.
APPROVE_ACCESS:  Returns True if a player can /approve jobs.
COMPLETE_ACCESS: Returns True if a player can /complete jobs.
CREATE_ACCESS:   Returns True if a player can use the /create command.
DENY_ACCESS:     Returns True if a player can /deny jobs.
EDIT_ACCCESS:    Returns True if a player can use the /edit command.
GIVE_ACCESS:     Returns True if a player can use +bucket/access.
LOG_ACCESS:      Returns True if a player can /log a job.
MAIL_ACCESS:     Returns True if a player can /query and /mail.
STATS_ACCESS:    Returns True if a player can pull reports on the system.

A player must pass HAS_ACCESS before the other locks are applied.

Access to buckets are set at the bucket level (see 'baccess').
You can also restrict actions by bucket (see 'aaccess').

Actions can be restricted by bucket. This allows you to customize the
available actions to, for instance, prevent jobs from being tampered
with in automated buckets. The format for this is:

&<action code>_ACCESS <bucket>=<return 1 to access, 0 to deny>

The <action>_ACCESS code allows for one argument: %0 == PlayerDB#.

Example: If you do not want a job to ever be transferred out
of an automated XP bucket (not included) you can prevent
this behavior if you know the three-letter action code (in this
example, TRN):

&TRN_ACCESS XP=0

See also: access, codes

Bucket access is set on the bucket itself, as the ACCESS attribute:

&ACCESS <Bucket DB#>=[switch(get(%0/RACE),VAMPIRE,1,0)]

It should return True for access and False for no access.
